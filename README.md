# pong-game

This is an old school pong game built on python using the 
turtle graphics library. 
The basic version of the game was built following the steps outlined in 
the "100 days of code" course on Udemy 
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Apart from the basic functionality that can be found in the lesson, 
I added the following features myself:

1) changed screen listen methods to onkeypress, so that users can just hold down the key instead of pressing it multiple times
2) paddles don't go outside of the upper and lower bounds of the screen
3) the screen pop up window asks for user names to address the winner by their name at the end of the game
4) the ball moves at an increasing speed as each round progresses
5) each game continues until the score is 5, then the winner's name is displayed
